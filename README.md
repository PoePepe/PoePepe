  Common Problems 
</h1
  <ul dir="auto">
    <li>Make sure <code>pathofexile.com/trade</code> is working and check if the provided link is valid.</li>
<li>Your Session ID might change. Keep it valid. Logging in and out refreshes your session ID.</li>
<li>You can only have 20 connections at once. It's a limit on <code>pathofexile.com/trade</code>, and you can't have more in your browser either.</li>
</ul>
